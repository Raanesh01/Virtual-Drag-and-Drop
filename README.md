# Virtual-Drag-and-Drop
Virtual Drag and Drop is an interactive project built using OpenCV and MediaPipe Hands, allowing users to manipulate images through hand gestures. By detecting finger positions in real-time, the system enables users to drag an image by crossing their first two fingers and drop it when they release the gesture.
